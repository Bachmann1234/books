<p>Let's build a programming book shelf together! Have there been books that you have read that really stood out and helped you improve your skills? If so please add them to this project. There are so many good books on programming and software development that it can be hard to find the right books for you. What this little project aims for is to provide you with an index of books, all recommended by other programmers.</p>

<h1>
<a name="organization" class="anchor" href="#organization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization</h1>

<p>There will be different categories, f.ex. programming books will be sub divided into language specific books. So books about Erlang will be listed in their own category under Programming Languages / Erlang. And a book about XP will be listed under Methodologies / XP.</p>

<a name="how-to-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-to-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to contribute?</h1>

<p>The most obvious way would of course be to fork this project and send a Pull Request, but I am nearly just as happy if you open an issue. And if you don't have a Github account nor will you ever get one, then by all means send me an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hello@about-programming.com">hello@about-programming.com</a> , but please don't use Twitter as your recommendation will most likely get lost in the noise.</p>
